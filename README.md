# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pilla (@deeegen)!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **hobbyist developer** who loves tinkering with code and PHP and Node.js.

---

## Developing Preferences

- **Language of Choice:** PHP (always my first love)
- **Workhorse:** Node.js (use it a lot, even if my heart is with PHP!)
- **Notable Projects:**
  - [`pilla-in-php`](https://github.com/deeegen/pilla-in-php) â€” PHP experimentation and fun.
  - `remote-rendezvous` â€” A long-gone relic, but it still taught me a lot.
- **Active Projects:**
  - [`pilla-in-php`](https://github.com/deeegen/pilla-in-php) â€” Not really "active" but being revamped into NodeJS
  - [`PortalBytes`](https://github.com/deeegen/portalbytes-v2/) â€” A nodeJS proxy that uses alloy AND corrosion in toggle.

---

## Interests

- **Roblox:** From game dev to casual play, always up for something new.
- **Motorcycles:** Admiring the two-wheeled life.
- **Alternative Scene Fashion:** Expressing myself through unique style and subcultures.
